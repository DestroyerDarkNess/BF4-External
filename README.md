## Q&A
Q. PBSS Bypass„ÅØ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÇ„Çã„ÅÆ„ÅãÔºü  
A. It's an external hack, so it's basically unnecessary. In fact, I've been unbanned for almost 100 hours without being detected„ÄÇ

Q. Detect?  
A. BF4 anti-cheat performs Sig-based program detection, so rewrite the code or use some Dotnet protector/packer, such as ConfuserEx / VMProtect or Enigma Protector to bypass Sig-based detection„ÄÇ
